Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) Methodology
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new expected credit loss accounting standard in June 2016. The new accounting standard introduces the current expected credit losses methodology (CECL) for estimating allowances for credit losses. The standard is effective for most SEC filers in fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and for all others it takes effect in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.

Until the new standard becomes effective, institutions should follow current U.S. GAAP along with the related supervisory guidance on the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).
